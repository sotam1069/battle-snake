# battle-snake
#CIIC-3015 Final Project

This is a simple battle-snake made in Python using AWS technologies and the BattleSnake API. 

Snake was made to pass the four solo challenges that appear on the website.

This includes - Avoiding Walls, Avoiding myself, Avoiding other snakes, and Find Food.

The snakes are implemented as very simple web servers.The game server connects to all of the snake servers and sends them updates
on the state of the board. The snake servers then process that information and return their next
move to the game server.
